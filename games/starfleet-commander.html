    <h1>Starfleet commander</h1>
    <h3>Make 'em go boom</h3>
    <p>Starfleet commander is a game similar to <a href="spacecraft.html">Spacecraft.</a> You still have to manage
      resources and fight off waves of enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>BUT</strong> there's one major difference. You don't control <strong>one ship</strong> but
      <strong>eight</strong> instead!
    </p>
    <p>This game was made for the Micro-jam and was in the top 25 (of over 100)</p>
    <p>Made in 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Play it here: <a href="https://sossinaydev.itch.io/starfleet-commander">Starfleet commander on itch.io</a></p>

    <h2>12.10.2024 - Balancing the unbalanced</h2>
    <p>In my head I always knew that this game is unbalanced. But when I was making this website I finally decided to
      create one more update for this awesome game!</p>
    <p>This update features some quality of life updates, balanced gameplay, better performance and some bugfixes</p>
    <h3>Scanner</h3>
    <p>The new scanner is a useful tool that indicates nearby planets. If the planets are closer, they will show up more
      often on your scans.</p>
    <p>The scan is triggered automatically every 20 seconds. All nearby planets have a random chance of blinking up as
      small symbols at the edge of the screen. This chance gets bigger, when the planet gets closer.</p>
    <h3>Less objects</h3>
    <p>Until now, the world had around 3000 objects scattered around.</p>
    <p>Now this was reduced to only 500</p>
    <h3>Balancing</h3>
    <p>I did a lot of stuff to make the game more balanced. Making the planets easier to find (with the scanner), and
      other things listed below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster & Cheaper shooting (Q-27)</li>
      <li>Cheaper healing</li>
      <li>Buffed upgrades</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also implemented the new difficulty system. With every wave, the game gets harder.</p>
    <p>More enemies, higher damage.</p>
    <p>This change allows the player to get used to the controls in the first few rounds, but they will be pushed to the
      limits after a few rounds.</p>
    <p>I just realize that I didnt add a wave counter. I apologize, but it's late and the game is already compiling...
    </p>
    <p>Make sure to check out the new update on <a href="https://sossinaydev.itch.io/starfleet-commander">itch.io!</a>
