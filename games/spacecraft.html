        <h1>Spacecraft</h1>
        <p>Spacecraft was a collaboration between Henryx and sossinay. Henryx made the art. We made a simple pve game, where you play as a spacecraft and have to fight off monsters. The game was made for a <strong>local gamejam</strong> in our city. It was huge success. We ended up winning and each of us got 200 bucks out of it.</p>
