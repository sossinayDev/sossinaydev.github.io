    <p><strong><em>One of the worst sandbox MMOs in existence</em></strong><br /><br />
      Starforge will be an MMO Sandbox game playing in space. It will consist of many solar systems scattered across
      different districts of the galaxy. The only rule outside of Galaxentre is: <strong>There are none.</strong></p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <h3 id="solar-system-simulation">Solar system simulation</h3>
    <p>Solar systems within Starforge are actually moving. The planets orbit the sun(s) <em>(Yes there are/will be
        multi-star systems)</em>, moons orbit their planets and moons of moons orbit moons. This system is made, so
      it&#39;s <strong>synchronized</strong> all around the globe. The positions of ships and objects are
      <strong>relative to the closest body</strong>. If you land your ship on the border of Ectoso and log off, when
      you log in you will still be on the border of Ectoso.
    </p>
    <h3>Multiplayer!</h3>
    <h3>Build your own ship!</h3>
    <p>Pay the <a href="https://starforgemmo.fandom.com/wiki/Ferga_(Station)">Ferga station</a> a visit and edit your
      ship! (Just don't forget to add an engine please)</p>
    <h2>Devlog</h2>

    <h3>04.08.2024 - Weapon system!</h3>
    <p>Ever wanted to take apart an enemy ship part by part! Do it now! The weapon system allows you to target a piece
      of the enemy ship and attack it, as long as it's in your weapons range. If you realize that the enemy is attacking
      your warp-engines, you might want to turn away, because once they're destroyed you won't have any chance of
      escapingâ€¦</p>
    <h4>Other features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>New texture for the Ferga station</li>
      <li>New Ferga ambient sound</li>
      <li>New system background images</li>
      <li>Backgrounds now move!</li>
      <li>Updated part stats, costs and boosts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What will the next update be about?</h4>
    <h5>Big visual update</h5>
    <p>The next update will be focused on enhancing the weapon system, giving it some visuals. I also want to add a way
      of showing the player the integrity of his parts.</p>
    <p>The parts will also receive new textures.</p>
    <p>You'll maybe see some new parts as well!</p>
    <h5>Solar system addons</h5>
    <p>Asteorid belts, more stations and maybe even some NPCs</p>
    <h4>Play now please!</h4>
    <p>Your feedback will help me shape the future of this game!</p>
